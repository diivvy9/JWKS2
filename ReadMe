Introduction
System Requirements: To deploy this application, your system must have the following:

Node.js (version 14 or above)
npm (Node Package Manager)

Setting Up
To get started, clone the repository to your machine with:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/jwt-jwks-server.git

Then, move to the project folder:
cd jwt-jwks-server

And install the necessary dependencies:

npm install

How to Use
Configuration Details: The server settings, including RSA key pair management, can be adjusted in the server.js file. Initially, the server creates a single RSA key pair for demonstration. For real-world applications, a more comprehensive key management approach is advisable.

Launching the Server
To initiate the server, execute:

npm start

The server operates on port 8080 by default, though this can be modified in the server.js file.

API Endpoints

/jwks Endpoint: This endpoint delivers public keys in the JWKS format, exclusively providing those that remain valid.
/auth Endpoint: Utilized for authentication and the creation of JWTs, this endpoint returns a valid, signed JWT upon a POST request. If an "expired" query is made, a JWT signed with an expired key and timestamp is issued.
